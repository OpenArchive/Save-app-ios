/**
 This extension provides some helper methods to hide/show `UIView`s.
 
 They are not only working on the `#isHidden` property, but also on height
 constraints, which will be modified, if existing or added anew, if not.
 
 Please note: This currently works properly only with horizontally designed
 layouts. For best effect, make all views dependent on their top neighbor's
 bottom and give height constraints to all necessary elements.
 
 You will be annoyed by a lot of constraint-break warnings, if the child elements
 also contain height constraints. They should be unproblematic. However, it is
 unclear how to avoid them without going through the hassle and remove all of
 them beforehand and restore them afterwards. (Which asks the question of the
 data structure to use for an adventure like that...)
